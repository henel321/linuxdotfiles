# Installation and Setup

## 1. Clone This Repo To Your Home Directory

```bash
git clone https://github.com/natesammons/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

## 2. Install Homebrew
Follow the instructions at [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### Install Brew Packages

```bash
bash ~/.dotfiles/brew_install.sh
```

### Fix `zsh-completions` permissions

Fix for the following error with zsh completions:

```bash
zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
# Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?
```

Run the following (inside `zsh`):

```bash
zsh
compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
```

See [this stackexchange.com thread](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/383365/zsh-compinit-insecure-directories-run-compaudit-for-list) for details.


## 3. Setup iTerm Font

Above we installed the "FiraCode NerdFont" and "Meslo LGL NerdFont" using brew.  Select one of these in iTerm as your font.

## 4. Make `zsh` your default shell

### Update Available Shells
Edit `/etc/shells` to add zsh from brew. Add the following lines:

```bash
# from brew
/usr/local/bin/zsh
```

### Change default shell for your user

```bash
chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh
```

Without this you will use the old version of zsh that ships with MacOS.

## 5. Install oh-my-zsh for `zsh`

Follow the instructions at [https://ohmyz.sh/](https://ohmyz.sh/)

[https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

This will nuke your `.zshrc` so donâ€™t make changes before installing it.  Run through the wizard and select the defaults.


### Install the `powerlevel10k` theme

[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel10k
```
[Powerlevel10K](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) is a [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k) re-implementation
that is a lot faster.

## 6. Install `Vundle` plugin for `vim`

[https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

## 7. Symlink `.zshrc` and `.vimrc` to this repo

Replaces these files in your home dir with symlinks to these files.

```bash
zsh ~/.dotfiles/init.sh
```

# 8. Run `vim` to initialize newly-configured plugins

Run `vim` to install plugins:

```bash
vim +PluginInstall +qall
```

# 9. Launch a new terminal

It should look like the screenshot above

# 10. Customize

The [`.zshrc`](zshrc) config sources files named `*.sh` in each of the following directories after setting everything else:

1. `~/.zsh.d`
1. `~/.zsh.d.$USER`
1. `~/.zsh.d.$(hostname -s)`

Files in each of these directories are run in alphabetic order (using `sort` on filenames)

# 11. Updates

Update everything by running the following commands:

```bash
zsh ~/.dotfiles/update.sh
```
